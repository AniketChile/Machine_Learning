Iris Dataset Logistic Regression Classifier
Overview:
This project implements a logistic regression classifier on the famous Iris dataset. Logistic regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. In this project, it's applied to the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers and their corresponding species.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), and a target variable specifying the species of the iris (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, if any, and to scale the features to ensure that they have a similar range.
Model Training: Logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to classify iris species based on their measurements.
Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure robustness of the model.
Deployment: Finally, the trained model is ready for deployment and further use in predicting the species of iris flowers based on their measurements.
